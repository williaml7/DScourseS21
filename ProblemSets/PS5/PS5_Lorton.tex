\section{CSS Selector Data}

I selected a table of data from \href{http://www.sharelatex.com}{this Wikipedia page}. It is a table of every rivalry game among teams that belong to the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). If applicable, it denotes the trophy that the winner receives, the first and last meeting between the two teams, and the total number of meetings. I may use this to help me make a dummy variable that states whether a team has beaten its 'biggest' rival in a given year. This might be used in my research pertaining to the relationship between collegiate sport performance and changes in the size/quality of an institution's applicant and admit pool. I used  \href{https://raw.githack.com/uo-ec607/lectures/master/06-web-css/06-web-css.html#1}{Grant R. McDermott's tutorial} and \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/vignettes/selectorgadget.html}{this} rvest package tutorial to help parse the data.

\section{API Data}

Getting some data on FBS team records from \href{https://collegefootballdata.com/}{here}. This will also be used in my research project (measuring team performance each year by W/L ratio, number of conference wins, etc.). I used the cfbscrapR package.
