\section{Data Sources for Scraping}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Financial news websites; perhaps search for mentions of EUR/USD, observe sentiment towards the cross, and see how this relates to its movement.
    \item Search Twitter for mentions of Daft Punk and see how people are reacting to the news of their breakup after 28 years.
    \item Search for statistics related to the balance (or lack thereof in some seasons) between OU football's defensive and offensive performances and see how this relates to each season's outcome.
\end{itemize}

\section{Answers for Question 6}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Verify that the two dataframe are different types: type class(df1) and class(df). What is the class of each?} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item df1 is a regular tibble (tbl df, tbl, data.frame)
        \item df is a spark tibble (tbl spark, tbl sql, tbl lazy, tbl)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Are the column names any different across the two objects? If so, why might that be?}
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Yes. df1 uses the period as a separator while df uses the underscore as a separator. Spark may not be able to use the period (or other special characters other than the underscore) when naming variables.
    \end{itemize}
